# JavaScript-Project-Snake-Game

## Description of the Project:

A Retro Snake Game inspired by the classic Nokia Snake game, created using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a square playing field in which food for the snake appears randomly. Players control the snake's movement using the arrow keys, directing it towards the food. Upon consuming food, the snake's size and movement speed increase. The objective is to score as many points as possible by eating food items, while ensuring the snake stays within the playing field and does not collide with itself. The player's current score and highest score are displayed above the playing field. To start the game, press Enter.

## Purpose of the Project:

This project was undertaken partly for fun, as I wanted to explore alternative uses of JavaScript beyond basic web page interactivity. Additionally, it provided an opportunity to deepen and reinforce my knowledge of JavaScript.

## Resource:

This project was created based on one of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) community video tutorials. You can find the tutorial link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyhzCBEGaBY&list=PLKtEu2gFifmTUMmJi-UTaDa2XyebRTWEa&index=1).

## Time intervals:

The project was completed in January 2024.
